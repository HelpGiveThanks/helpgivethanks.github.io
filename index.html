                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">The Spacewalk, created by Frank Belgau, is an experiment that should reveal various levels of foundational intelligences (the intelligences on which academic intelligences are built), and increase participants' IQs as they begin to master its exercises. See research below!<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">All Space Walk activities can be duplicated in chalk on the playground, at home, the park, etc. They do not have to be permanently painted somewhere! Create a Toe-on-Spot course where the dots are unevenly spaced and then hop or walk to them. Mix up the activities using the symbols from the course to challenge your brain to continually switch tasks, like five feet of toe-on-spot, then four feet of jump and turn then two more feet of toe-on-spot, then six feet of hop- toe-on-line, etc. Be creative and have fun!<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">To master the Space Walk exercises, students must perform knowledgeable, efficient, precise, rhythmic, symmetrical, and relaxed body movements. This form defines these requirements, and allows students in small groups to evaluate each other, and in so doing practice and learn critical thinking skills. Older students can evaluate each other, while younger students can be evaluated by older students. <br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Students can learn how to evaluate any physical movement activity from what they learn using the form, which will help them in sports, but also help them practice critical thinking skills necessary to break down any problem into smaller parts, discuss problems productively with others, ask questions based on genuine curiosity, etc.<br /></span></p>

These two systems work closely with the RAS system (reticular activation system) that is located at the top of the brain stem and is critical to our attentional system. These systems interact to keep our balance, turn thinking into action, and coordinate moves.

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">[pdf 30-31 Luppe, 2007] Barrett (2000) theorizes that students who fail to experience sufficient movement, or who experience developmental delays in visual perception, tracking, balance, and gross-motor skills, and fall behind in school need sensory-motor remediation, not content remediation. Content assimilation can only happen when basic sensory-motor skills have developed, when the ability to use both sides of the brain-body in an integrated fashion for efficient action has developed (Jones, 2005).<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Fadigan (as cited by Barrett, 2000) has extensively reviewed the research of educational, neuroscience, and psychology experts. His findings reveal the brain develops its ability to process information first at level one (conception to 2 years), when various sensory-motor skills are developed; then level two, when cognitive skills or multiple intelligences are acquired; then finally to level three, after enhancement of levels one and two, when content assimilation occurs. He offers an interesting consideration: most public and private schools teach exclusively at level three, and when a student exhibits problems assimilating content at this level, he or she is given remediation (usually in the form of additional content either in one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction), which doesn't adequately address the root of the problem. These students need experience at the sensory motor level to create neurological pathways, and only then can content assimilation occur.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Kokot (2003) reveals similar findings. For a child to experience success in learning areas, a number of underlying sensory-motor systems have to be functioning as well. If the vestibular, proprioceptive, tactile, visual, and auditory systems are malfunctioning, they will fail to support the child's attempts to learn academic work, sit still, pay attention, complete tasks, and learn appropriate social behaviors. Furthermore, she states these sensory systems develop according to a hierarchy. Success on one level is necessary for success on the next. If any of these developmental steps have been interrupted or skipped, it is likely to affect the degree to which the child experiences academic success. </span><br /></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Research conducted by neurophysiologist Carla Hannaford indicates that the inner ear's semicircular canals and the vestibular nuclei are an information-gathering and feedback source for movement. The impulses travel through nerve tracts back and forth from the cerebellum (the part of the brain involved in almost all learning) to the rest of the brain, including the visual system and the sensory cortex. These impulses also seem to impact areas in the brain critical to attention. All together, these actions help human beings to maintain balance, turn thought into action, and coordinate moves. Hannaford supports participation in activities that stimulate inner ear motion such as swinging, rolling, and jumping (Jensen, 1998).<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Other researchers have linked pathways from the cerebellum to parts of the brain involved in memory, attention, and spatial perception. Movement and learning seem to have &quot;constant interplay&quot; (Jensen 1998). More than 80 studies presented at the 1995 Annual Society of Neuroscience Conference suggested strong links between the cerebellum and memory, spatial perception, language, attention, emotion, nonverbal cues, and decision-making. According to Eric Jensen (1998), a former teacher and member of the International Society of Neuroscience, these findings strongly implicate the value of physical education, movement, and games in boosting cognition. Research suggests that the relationship between movement and learning continues throughout life.<br /></span></p>

We examined: (1) reliability and age related changes in reading acuity scores, (2) the effect of vestibular hypofunction on reading acuity scores, and (3) the relationship between these scores and a test of dynamic visual acuity. RESULTS: The test was reliable (ICC (3,2)&gt;or=0.86). Reading acuity scores were significantly worse in children with vestibular hypofunction (p&lt;or=0.002). Furthermore, reading acuity scores correlated with dynamic not static visual acuity scores (r=0.55, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that the gaze instability due to vestibular hypofunction affects reading ability in young children.  [*Diminished, abnormally low, or inadequate functioning]<br /></span></p>

Consequently, those areas of your brain that you once just used for thought and memory, now must constantly work on keeping you balanced. As a result, your memory may suffer. You may grope for words when talking. You may easily forget what is being spoken about during a conversation. You may be easily distracted. You may have difficulty comprehending directions or instructions. You may have trouble concentrating and may feel disoriented at times.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">You may also experience fatigue because keeping your balance is now no longer a subconscious event, but something that you must consciously work hard to maintain. All this work makes you tired!<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Vestibular damage may also give rise to muscular aches and pains. This is because when your vestibulo-spinal reflex no longer works automatically, you have to consciously control your balance by making your muscles rigid and less relaxed as you strain to keep your balance. In addition, you may get headaches and a stiff/sore neck from trying to hold your head absolutely still so you won't feel dizzy or nauseous.<br /></span></p>

                <p class="paragraph_style"><span class="style_2">Finally, damage to your vestibular system can include emotional problems such as anxiety, frustration, anger and depression. Your feelings of self-confidence and self-esteem may plummet. You may feel vaguely uneasy. You may feel that something is wrong or unreal without knowing why.<br /></span></p>

Their signals are so tightly integrated that it is impossible to unravel them through introspection, a view which seems to favor vision as the primary sense organ of the mind. But whereas in the congenitally blind other senses more or less compensate for the loss, a child born without proprioception would not know it had a body and would be physically and mentally retarded as a result.</span><br /></p>
